# Art X Ml : Urban Jungle

Project 1: Frames and Biases

Algorithm/Tools used:

- Neural Doodle
- Style Transfer: Masked Style Transfer (Naive / Masked Style Loss)
- Deep Dream: Segmented Deep Dream

To run the code:

- Masked_style_transfer.ipynb shows the two masked style transfer algorithms used and described in the report, as well as a few examples. It is possible to run it with different images (from the images folder), corresponding masks (from the masks folder) and style imags (from the style folder).
- Segmented_deep_dream.ipynb shows the segmented DeepDream algorithm and some examples. It can also be run on other images from the images folder.
- Foreground_segmentation.ipynb implements a foreground detection algorithm that can help creating masks (although we mostly used manual masks).
